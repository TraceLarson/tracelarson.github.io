Viewable Web page for DWS2 project

This is the web application for the Week one project for Designing for Web Standards II - Online at Full Sail University.

This page is being created using HTML5, CSS3, GULP, and SASS.

This web app is utilizing the Marvel API. To operate simply type a search string in the search bar and click the search button.
The string can include almost any marvel character, although spaced and hyphenated names may take a couple tries.
Also the response time from marvel can be somewhat slow at times, so be patient while waiting. If you are unsure if the
request went through try opening the developer console. I have logged a response string to let you know if the
request is valid or not.
